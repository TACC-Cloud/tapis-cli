Release Notes

Read below how Tapis CLI has improved over time. We follow semantic versioning,
so you can safely assume that upgrades across point.point releases will not
require you to change your existing workflows or usage patterns. The exception
to this is when we add entirely new commands or functions (such as
integration with GitHub or the like).
