What is Tapis CLI
=================

Tapis CLI is a human-friendly, scriptable command line interface, implemented in
Python, that helps scientists and engineers build and manage scalable computational
and data science workflow projects using the _Tapis platform. It is a
replacement for a pure-Bash CLI environment known as agave-cli that we hope
brings you new features, better reliability, and dramatically enhanced
productivity.

Tapis CLI provides a unified interface to multiple web service APIs, allowing them
to be easily orchestrated and composed into higher-order constructs combining
HPC, data management, cloud computing, and other aspects of computing.
